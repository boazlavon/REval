Think step by step. Your thoughts should be concise and contain no more than 10 steps. For loop logics, express your thoughts without detailing each iteration. Provide your answer in [ANSWER] and [/ANSWER] tags, following the examples.\n\n[PYTHON]\ndef f(a, b):\n    ans = a + b\n    if ans > 0:\n        ans = int(a)\n    else:\n        ans = b\n    return ans\n\nf(1.1, 2)\n[/PYTHON]\n[QUESTION]\nIs Line 4 (        ans = int(a)) executed when f(1.1, 2) is called?

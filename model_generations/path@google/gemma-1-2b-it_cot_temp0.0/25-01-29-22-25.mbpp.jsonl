Provide your answer in [ANSWER] and [/ANSWER] tags, following the examples.\n\n[PYTHON]\ndef f(a, b):\n    ans = a + b\n    if ans > 0:\n        ans = int(a)\n    else:\n        ans = b\n    return ans\n\nf(1.1, 2)\n[/PYTHON]\n[QUESTION]\nIf the line `        ans = int(a)` is executed when f(1.1, 2) is called, answer with the next line of code to be executed inside the function. Do NOT answer lines in the test code. If not or program terminates after this line, answer with -1.\n[/QUESTION]\n[THOUGHT]\n1. Function f is called with arguments a=1.1 and b=2. Thus ans should be 1.1 + 2 = 3.1.\n2. Since ans is greater than 0, line `ans = int(a)` is executed.\n3. After this line, the program jumps out of the if block and returns ans. Thus, the answer should be return ans.\n[/THOUGHT]\n[ANSWER]\nreturn ans\n[/ANSWER]\n\n[PYTHON]\ndef f(a, b):\n    ans = a + b\n    if ans > 0:\n        ans = int(a)\n    else:\n        ans = b\n    return ans\n\nf(1.1, -2)\n[/PYTHON]\n[QUESTION]\nIf the line `        ans = int(a)` is executed when f(1.1, -2) is called, answer with the next line of code to be executed inside the function.

Thus ans should be 1.1 - 2 = -0.9.\n2. Since ans is not greater than 0, line `ans = b` is executed, while line `ans = int(a)` is not executed.\n3.
